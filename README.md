Final Project 1051- Visual Novel 
YOUTUBE VIDEO - https://youtu.be/E4GuDQLp_7M 
Overview: I made general plot, incorporating different characters of the game, with a dialogue. Each character has its oen purpose in the plot and it is up to the user to figure out how to get a good ending. 

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to entertain the users. Visual novels are not only a game but also story telling in a unique way where the decisions made by the user directly affects how to story goes on, leading to different paths and endings. That is why it is important that the story interacts with the user, if not it would not be a game. 

Difficulties I faced or overcame: Difficulties that I faced and overcame were learning how to use renpy and utilizing all it's functions. I had trouble learning how to navigate but I overcame them by watching youtube tutorials. Creating a unique story and having to make a dialogue and somehow also include user choices was difficult to come up with and I would say the game I ended up with is a lot different than the original plan. 
 
What I enjoyed: I enjoyed creating my own characters. It was fun sketching designs and coloring them even though it was tedious and a long process to deal with. Watching everything come together was very rewarding.
